# om.next with sablono

This repo is just a little experiment to see how om.next and sablono work together.
It's learning out loud....

Uses boot-cljs for bould.

To run: `boot dev` then in browser `http://localhost:3000`

This logs the the current state to the JS console  before each
call to `transact!`, triggered by the `go` button.
